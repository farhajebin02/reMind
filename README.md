Project Description
Remind is an app designed to assist individuals living with dementia by providing tools to recognize family members, set reminders, and stay connected with loved ones. It includes features like real-time speech recognition, face recognition, and an emergency contact system.

The Problem Statement
Living with dementia can make daily tasks challenging. Recognizing family members, remembering important tasks, and handling emergencies are common issues. This app aims to ease these challenges and improve the quality of life for dementia patients and their families.

The Solution
We are solving these problems by creating a user-friendly app that:

Helps users recognize family members using face recognition.
Sends reminders for medication, appointments, or daily activities.
Provides quick access to emergency contacts with just a tap.
Uses speech recognition to allow hands-free interaction.
